# Introduction

This is the documentation of my work. Here you will find what I planned for this project since the start of it. I plan to include more feature in it like zombies following you, and levels.

# Story

In this game, you play as a runner and your objectives are to collect stars and not run into zombies. Just like in real life, you get one shot at this. This is an endless game so you have the opportunity to collect stars as long as you keep yourself alive.The player's score will increase by 10 points every time he collects a star. The game is over when the player collides with an enemy.

# Gameplay 

## Player
 
The player can:
- Move to the right, left, upwards, and downwards across the game's screen using arrow keys.
- Shoot enemies by pressing the Spacebar key.

## Enemies
- The enemy is a zombie

# Acknowledgements

- This project was built during my course at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/), which is an amazing school where I learned how to program. Also, Microverse provided me with an [API](https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/) to keep the player's scores.
